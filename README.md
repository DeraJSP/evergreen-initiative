## Abstract
With increasing pressure from climate change, deforestation, pollution, and other threats that require urgent attention and collaborative action the evergreen initiative was born.
The Evergreen Initiative is a web application designed to provide users/farmers with valuable information about soil types, climate conditions, and suitable plants for cultivation based on their location as well as machinery to aid the process.
Knowing what crops would thrive in favourable growing conditions and availability of the farm machinery will potentially increase agricultural crop production significantly.
